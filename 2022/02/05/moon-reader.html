                        <p>I’m always on the lookout for a good
                        e-reading app. I primarily read on Android and
                        I’ve used the Kindle for Android app in the
                        past. My current favorite is <a
                        href="http://moondownload.com/">Moon+
                        Reader</a>. Let’s walk through why and how I use
                        it.</p>

                        <h2>Reader View &amp; My Setup</h2>
                        <p>Apart from supporting a wide variety of

                        <br />
                        </span></span>, the reading interface is very
                        customizable. The options are too many to list
                        but there is enough flexibility built in to be
                        on par with the best. My go to changes for a
                        pleasant reading interface are pretty close to
                        the Kindle app’s defaults, to be honest.</p>

                        since I seem to love nice thick serifs on a

                        different visual settings. I also keep the

                        time in the chapter along with the overall time
                        remaining in the book are all I need. I also
                        quite enjoy the page curl animation, which is
                        set to Apple Books style.<span

                        the sides that may be off putting to some and
                        quite dislike hyphenation of text on such a
                        small screen, which is why it’s only left
                        aligned and not justified.</p>

                        <h2>Annotations</h2>
                        <p>The beauty of Moon+ Reader lies in the
                        elegance of its annotation interface. For
                        converts from the Kindle app like myself, the
                        touch and drag of text creates a highlight. This
                        can then be modified to the correct
                        color/annotation type.<span

                        word/phrase that encompasses highlights,
                        underlines, strikethroughs, etc. but this will
                        have to do for now, it seems.<br />
                        <br />
                        </span></span> Color choices are quite flexible
                        as well. In fact, it allows defining custom
                        colors across the RGB spectrum with adjustable
                        alpha values, giving one a theoretical ceiling
                        of 16<sup>8</sup> colours.<span

                        </span></span> Of course, you’d probably want to
                        stick to a trusty few that you’re accustomed
                        to.</p>

                        <p>In my case, it’s blue for anecdotes or
                        disagreements with the author, yellow for new
                        words I want to add to my vocabulary, orange for
                        references to other texts or potential avenues
                        of research I want to chase down, red for
                        particularly good quotes that I want to use in
                        the future, and gray for something I want to
                        convert to a flashcard. You’ll notice that these
                        are the same colors that we have on the Kindle
                        app, except gray.</p>
                        <p>Now, this may seem overly elaborate but just
                        because the option exists doesn’t mean you’re
                        forced to use it. I’ve simply found this to be
                        optimal for my reading flow. I should also point
                        out that underlines, strike throughs, and other
                        annotations are also supported and that the
                        interface is rather seamless.</p>
                        <p>It allows for overlapping highlights, so I
                        can put a yellow one inside a red highlight.
                        Annotation is also more precise compared to
                        Kindle’s annotation interface as the em dash

                        word and then drag the selection handles across
                        to highlight a specific piece of text that you
                        found tricky or to create the aforementioned
                        nested highlights. This can also be triggered by
                        using the “Text Selection” option under the More

                        export schema is decent to work with and has
                        only a few minor annoyances, chief of them being

                        to my note taking app of choice, <a

                        parsed by some JavaScript.<span

                        class="sidenote">To be specific, the parsing is
                        done inside a script that runs inside a JS
                        environment from a plugin named Templater, but
                        that’s a bit much to get into right now.
                        JavaScript is also weirdly fun. <a

                        </span></span> The script extracts only the gray
                        highlights so that I can add flashcards to my

                        when I feel they’re “stable” but I haven’t quite

                        flashcards as I’m reading through the book. It
                        does take extra effort but if it pays dividends
                        by providing better long term understanding and
                        retention, it is quite worthwhile.<span

                        <p>Moon+ Reader also handles footnotes quite
                        well. You get a nice yellow pop-up, similar to a
                        note, that can be scrolled through. Often, you
                        can also jump to the footnotes location and
                        later jump back to your original reading
                        position. Like other features, the footnote
                        color, popup styles, etc. can also be
                        customized.</p>

                        find this useful if you have an Android tablet,

                        <p>Integrated dictionaries are available but not
                        as seamless as Kindle, where the dictionary is
                        in-app. Instead, it opens up a separate app
                        depending on what you’ve configured. It also
                        doesn’t seem to properly interface with an on
                        device dictionary such as Merriam Webster. If
                        you try to share to it, it doesn’t receive the
                        input and most dictionary apps appear to contain
                        ads anyway. I get around this by passing the
                        selected text to a web search query in my
                        browser, which more often than not does the

                        <p>The dictionary is definitely a weak point. An
                        in-app copy of the Oxford Dictionary would go a
                        long way. I suspect there may be licensing
                        issues or something of the sort that get in the
                        way. I also don’t think it can open a different

                        select the dictionary when using the search bar
                        in the Kindle app, as further evidence of it

                        <p>I’ve also had some issues with vertical
                        scrolling. With page turn animations enabled,
                        tapping any area outside a small-ish central
                        region results in the app turning pages. It
                        seems to work perfectly fine if page turn
                        animations are disabled, however, using the full
                        width of the screen for scrolling. It’s been a
                        mildly annoying problem so far but hasn’t
                        stopped me from reading. Maybe I should just
                        disable animations at some point if it grates me
                        further. Most books I read on the Kindle app
                        didn’t have page turn animations enabled
                        anyway.</p>
                        <p>I’ve also noticed that PDF annotation exports
                        are garbage. Can’t be a wizard at everything, I
                        suppose.</p>
