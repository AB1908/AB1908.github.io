                        <h2>Who this guide is for?</h2>
                        <p>Any person looking to get started but feels
                        that the documentation is too intimidating. <a
                        href="https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/An+Introduction+to+Dataview">SkepticMystic’s
                        guide</a> is actually a better guide to help you
                        get started writing queries. This should be
                        viewed as a supplement to it. That said, if
                        you’re a programmer or database expert who’s
                        looking to get started quickly, this guide
                        probably isn’t it. Check out the <a
                        href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">docs</a>
                        instead.</p>

                        <h2>What is dataview?</h2>
                        <p>It’s a plugin by <a
                        href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu">blacksmithgu</a>.
                        It lets you query data from your Obsidian
                        vault.</p>
                        </section>

                        <h2>What’s a query?</h2>
                        <p>Think of a query as a question you want to
                        ask your Obsidian vault. For example,</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>What notes did I modify in the last 5
                        days?</li>
                        <li>Which movies are tagged
                        <code>#towatch</code>?</li>
                        <li>What tasks have I tagged
                        <code>#critical</code>?</li>
                        <li>List my favorite books in descending order
                        of rating.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are just a few examples of what is
                        possible with dataview. Note that you
                        <strong>can’t</strong> change your metadata with
                        dataview. Look into <a

                        <h2>Great, how do I get started?</h2>
                        <p>It’s actually pretty easy to get started.
                        Just install the plugin from the “Community
                        Plugins” list after turning off safe mode.</p>

                        <h2>But wait, how do I query?</h2>
                        <p>Use a dataview code block like so:</p>
                        <pre><code>```dataview
list
from &quot;Folder&quot;

                        <p>The syntax is rather extensive so refer to
                        the docs copiously. I still do so even after
                        having used dataview for 6 months at the time of
                        writing.</p>

                        </span></span> “metadata” from your notes.
                        Metadata is meta information about your notes
                        and files. Some of the common metadata fields
                        you might be familiar with are things like “last
                        modified date”, “file creation date”, “file
                        extension”, etc.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of metadata, for the
                        purposes of dataview. The one we looked at above
                        was “implicit metadata”, which exists for every
                        file in your vault. The list of fields can be
                        found <a
                        href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/#implicit-fields">in
                        the docs</a>. Note some of the more useful
                        ones:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><code>file.name</code></li>
                        <li><code>file.path</code></li>
                        <li><code>file.mtime</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There’s a second type of (arguably) more
                        useful metadata — the one we define. This lets
                        you create your own indexes to query. Lets look
                        at some examples.</p>
                        <p>Book.md</p>
                        <pre><code>---
title: &quot;Iliad&quot;
author: &quot;Homer&quot;
---</code></pre>
                        <p>Movie.md</p>
                        <pre><code>---
title: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;
year: 1941
director: &quot;Orson Welles&quot;
---</code></pre>
                        <p>Note that for <code>Book.md</code> and
                        <code>Movie.md</code>, the metadata defined
                        there is actually YAML frontmatter. The Obsidian
                        Help docs have a useful section on <a
                        href="https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter">what
                        that is</a>. Dataview supports YAML but also has
                        support for a custom variant called “<a
                        href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/">inline
                        YAML</a>”, specific only to Dataview.</p>
                        <p>Inline YAML is a non-standard YAML-like way
                        of specifying additional metadata. This is what
                        is depicted in the example below. It follows the
                        <code>key:: value</code> style. Note that it
                        currently doesn’t support nested fields the same
                        way standard YAML does.</p>
                        <p>Example.md</p>
                        <pre><code>This is a sample note. Today I met person:: Adam.</code></pre>
                        <p>Now that we have some files and metadata
                        defined, let’s talk about indexes, which is what
                        you’re querying against. It’s helpful to think
                        of an index as one big ’ol table that you’re
                        trying to narrow down to precisely what you
                        need. So, in this case, say we had these three
                        metadata examples in our vault, our index would
                        look like this:</p>

                        <p>We queried the <code>title</code> from our
                        index but Dataview also gives us the

                        <p>The rows in your index will depend on what
                        source you’re using. If you’re using
                        <code>""</code> as a source, the rows will be
                        all the files in the vault. If you’re using
                        <code>#tag</code> as a source, the rows will be
                        all the files with that tag in them. The columns
                        in your index will depend on the metadata that
                        you’ve defined in your files. Task indexes
                        (<code>- [ ]</code> elements that you use for
                        TODOs) are different and they’ll be covered in a
                        separate guide.</p>
                        <p>To narrow this table down, we typically use
                        filters or <code>WHERE</code> conditions. For
                        layering complication logic, we use <a

                        <h2>What are some gotchas about YAML?</h2>
                        <p>A very important caveat is that this is
                        <em>all</em> you can query. You cannot query the
                        <em>contents</em> of your files. File content is
                        not part of metadata. Remember, metadata is
                        either explicity or implicitly defined as we
                        discussed earlier.</p>
                        <p>Another gotcha is that wikilinks in Obsidian
                        Frontmatter are not clickable, nor do they show
                        up on your graph. This is a current Obsidian
                        limitation.</p>
                        <p>Finally, metadata for each file is
                        independent of the other. To rephrase, it means
                        that each file has its own metadata.</p>

                        <h2>How should I define my YAML?</h2>
                        <p>This is a difficult question. You can add
                        nearly any kind of metadata you want to your
                        notes. The open ended nature of this makes it
                        difficult to design “schemas”.<span

                        <p>One solid piece of advice when it comes to
                        “designing metadata” is to think of your end
                        goal first. It’s counterintuitive, I know, but
                        it’ll give you a good idea of what fields you
                        need to use. You can look at the forums for

                        class="level2">
                        <h2>How to debug your queries?</h2>
                        <p>It’s a little difficult to write a correct
                        query on your first try. I still find it tricky
                        even after having used Dataview for more than 8
                        months at the time of writing. A general rule of
                        thumb is to start with the simpler version of a
                        query and then slowly progress to the actual
                        query that you want.</p>
                        <p>Another helpful tip is to actually inspect
                        the metadata that’s being queried. You can do
                        this by enabling inline DVJS in the plugin
                        settings and then typing
                        <code>`dv.list([dv.current()])`</code> to
                        inspect that note’s metadata. Remember to use
                        that in a page that actually has the metadata
                        since you’re likely writing the query in a
                        separate file. You’ll note that everything you
                        can query about that page shows up in a bulleted
                        list.</p>
                        <p>Finally, for debugging more complex queries,
                        these often error out because of some
                        assumptions you’ve made about the data you’re
                        querying or the functions you’re using. Common
                        ones include syntax errors and type mismatches.
                        Test those assumptions by checking the docs.</p>
                        <p>Let’s also do a quick rundown of some of the
                        common errors/issues.</p>

                        <h3>Some rows are missing</h3>
                        <p>You expected some rows in the output
                        table/list but they’re not there. This usually
                        happens when your <code>FROM</code> or
                        <code>WHERE</code> is incorrect. If your where
                        looks correct, your condition is incorrect. This
                        typically happens when your types are
                        mismatched, such as:</p>
                        <ul>

                        array</li>

                        doesn’t work.” Often, this happens because the
                        way you think dataview works isn’t the way it
                        actually works, i.e. you’ve made incorrect
                        assumptions. This happens fairly often when
                        doing programming related stuff so fret not. The
                        easiest way is to test this separately and
                        thoroughly consult the documentation.</p>

                        <h3>My output doesn’t look correct</h3>
                        <p>For example, you expected “2022-10-10” but
                        Dataview shows you 10 October, 2022. Dataview
                        converts date strings into <code>date</code>
                        objects. These are displayed using the
                        <code>DD MMMM, YYYY</code> format. It’s actually
                        tricky to work around this. I’ll cover types at
                        some point in the future.</p>

                        <p>Dataview handles wikilinks a little
                        differently. If you try to do
                        <code>FROM [[certain file]]</code> in a query,
                        it’s actually looking up all files that link to
                        <code>[[certain file]]</code> and not
                        <code>certain file</code> itself. Dataview calls
                        this “inlinks”. Files linked to by the current
                        file are called “outlinks”. See the <a

                        shy to drop by on the Discord server either!
                        Mention me in the <code>#dataview</code> thread
                        or in <code>#plugin-advanced</code> and I’ll be
                        more than happy to help you out.</p>
