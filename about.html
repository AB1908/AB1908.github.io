<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>You could just call this a public ramble. But really, it’s just a series of thoughts or notes on stuff I’ve found interesting. I’m sure people have experienced or already know most of what I’ll probably write about since [[nothing is ever original]] but even so, I enjoy writing and sharing. It certainly doesn’t help that I find too many things interesting but, on the flip side, more stuff to write about!</p>
</section>
<section id="why-is-this" class="level2">
<h2>Why is this?</h2>
<p>Like any person who has struggled with memory, I write notes. My initial desire for taking notes stemmed from constantly forgetting things that I had read or watched. I never really took the time to understand how memory worked, which was odd considering how I often liked diving into minutiae. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Or I could just say I was lazy.<br />
<br />
</span></span> It was compounded by my interest in data collection and hoarding. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/datahoarder">r/datahoarder</a> is that way.<br />
<br />
</span></span> My final push came from watching [[Ali Abdaal]]’s videos. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8">explained</a> how notes were an integral part <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://aliabdaal.com/building-a-second-brain/">Link</a> to the accompanying blog post<br />
<br />
</span></span> of his <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">“second brain”</a>. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I’m beginning to dread the phrase but it has caught on.<br />
<br />
</span></span> It was through his videos that I discovered <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>. You can read why I disliked it [[404|here]], which led me to Obsidian.</p>
<p>Things kinda snowballed from there and here I am on my own website trying to share what I’m thinking. Since I’m here, here’s a few shout-outs to some of my other inspirations: <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The <a href="https://xkcd.com/about/">About page</a> explains that it’s stylised as “xkcd” or “XKCD” for [[The Elements of Style]] readers.<br />
<br />
<span class="blockquote">How do I write “xkcd”? There’s nothing in Strunk and White about this.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="blockquote">For those of us pedantic enough to want a rule, here it is: The preferred form is “xkcd”, all lower-case. In formal contexts where a lowercase word shouldn’t start a sentence, “XKCD” is an okay alternative. “Xkcd” is frowned upon.</span><br />

<br />
</span></span> I hope you enjoy reading my articles as much as I love writing them. It’s probably not the most eloquent or well informed stuff you’ll find but hey, I’m trying. Cheers!</p>

<section id="where-will-this-go" class="level2">
<h2>Where will this go?</h2>
<p>Good question. I could paraphrase Captain Kirk <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_no_man_has_gone_before">“To boldly go where no man has before”</a> for the uninitiated among us.<br />
<br />
</span></span> but I’d be lying.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-do-you-use" class="level2">
<h2>What do you use?</h2>
<p>For taking notes, my app of choice is <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> which aligns very closely with my personal philosophies on data ownership and privacy. It’s extremely extensible and it seems to have the perfect combination of features that I’m looking for. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I recently found [an extension][Obsidian Pandoc extension] for pandoc attributes!<br />
<br />
</span></span> The community is extremely kind and helpful too, which always helps. It runs offline (unlike Notion) and I always have my data with me. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I may even have my first Notion convert soon. You know who you are!<br />
<br />
</span></span> There are some concerns of Obsidian using non standard Markdown spec <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Fellow nerds will know this as <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/">CommonMark Spec</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> but I digress.</p>
<p>As for publishing my thoughts and articles, I don’t use <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian Publish</a> as I feel that I want to structure content in my own fashion. I settled on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for now which is apparently a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site generator behind the scenes and it looks nice and minimalist to me. I wished I could use <a href="https://textile-lang.org">Textile</a> but seeing as how my notes are already in Markdown and I’m already parsing them through [pandoc][pandoc], the Swiss army knife of document converters, I can’t bear to add my friction to my workflow. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Pandoc Markdown is just as versatile, it turns out.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I also love <a href="https://sembr.org/">structuring content semantically</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version control</a> is always important too, hence <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>. The two things above help me generate nice diffs should I ever want to.</p>
<p>I absolutely love sidenotes and footnotes so anyone who finds my rather frequent remarks annoying can always just ignore them. In my opinion, they inject a bit of personality to an otherwise heartless page of reading. I use a modified version of [Tufte CSS][Tufte CSS] <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Such a beautiful website!<br />
<br />
</span></span> which I found by perusing through Gwern’s blog post. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Truly one of the hallmarks of blogging. I strongly suggest reading through his stuff. The man uses a custom JS script to load his footnotes.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The modification part took quite a bit of time and I’ve described that entire headache [[Footnotes in web content]]. My font of choice is [Crimson Text][Crimson Text] and my base Jekyll theme is Primer. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I didn’t like the other choices.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I will no doubt switch to a more Obsidian-like theme soon but I aim to get more stuff written first. <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">[[Perfect is the enemy of good]].<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>I’ve also found that <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss">karlicoss</a> has <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/">an amazing blog</a> <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It’s really really good if you’re a programming nerd and are also into knowledge management.<br />
<br />
</span></span> built atop of <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> but my journey with that is yet to begin.<!-- #website/org-mode  --> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> is a must have, in my opinion, so vim bindings wherever possible.</p>
